# Electra Whitepaper v3.0

Our new White Paper is the third release and explains in-depth the details of the Electra Project’s current status and future goals. It provides background on our two recent “forks” and the new technology incorporated into Electra because of them. This White Paper also provides the framework for establishing Electra’s ambitious goal, to be the future of money, and how we’re in the process of achieving it. Future updates to the White Paper are expected as the Project continues to advance at a rapid pace.
